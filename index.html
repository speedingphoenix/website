      <p>
        This is a remake of my first website. This is also going to be like a

      <p>
        I will show old websites that I have made in the past, and I will show
        all of my drawings that I have drawn since begining of 2020 (since
        covid-19 came -_-).

      <h2>More about me as a person</h2>
      <p>For starters, who am I?</p>
      <p>
        My real name is not "Speedingphoenix", it is more my username for
        different sites or social media. Like steam, discord or instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        More about me, I am a 18 year old girl that goes to a highschool in
        Sweden. I live in the countryside, but my school is in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not a stright A-student more like a C or up student. I study
        computer scince in school, like programming and a lot of math/physics
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like to either play video games, draw or watch
        movies/series. I like to play RPG:s (Roll Playing Games), draw my own OC
        ( original character) and my favorite genre in movies/series are
        animated, horror or comedy.
